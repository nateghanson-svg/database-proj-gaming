My final project for CS-1103 focusing on different video games across all platforms.
Proposal: 
This will likely focus on only around 20 games from each platform, including smoe on multiple platforms.
Each game will have a title, release year, company, and copies sold column. 
The primary key will be game_id - an exclusive number given to each game.
